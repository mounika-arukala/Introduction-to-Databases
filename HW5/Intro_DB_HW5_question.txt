Turn in
Turn in in the files queries.txt using the canvas upload file thingy. You may turn in your assignment as many times as you like.

Grading
The assignment will be graded for functionality. 

CouchDB
Your task is to install a NoSQL database using CouchDB (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and write some queries.

Here are some destructions on installing and running on MS/Windows  (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.

Using CouchDB
Download and configure the software for your system. Then create a database, and within that database a document. To that document add the data in the file data.txtPreview the documentView in a new window. The couchDB lecture notesPreview the documentView in a new window have some useful hints on how to do this.

Deliverables
A text file, queries.txt, containing solutions in JSON to the following queries. The file should be formatted as follows (values of the fields will vary!). Again, see the couchDB lecture notesPreview the documentView in a new window on how to get this view of the data.
